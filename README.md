Compiler for a little toy language, made for WPI's CS4533 (Prog Lang
Translation) as taught by Matthew Ahrens. Compiler is based on the

by Jeremy G. Siek. I decided to write it from scratch in Rust instead of
using the provided Python infrastructure though.

TODO:
- Partial eval multiply by 0 or 1
- Variable indexing
- Variable shift
