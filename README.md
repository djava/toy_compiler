Compiler for a little toy language, made for WPI's CS4533 (Prog Lang
Translation) as taught by Matthew Ahrens. Compiler is based on the
textbook *Essentials of Compilation: An Incremental Approach in Python*
by Jeremy G. Siek. I decided to write it from scratch in Rust instead of
using the provided Python infrastructure though.
